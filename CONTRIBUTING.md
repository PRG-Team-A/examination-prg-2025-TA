# Contributing

## Setting up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <Repository_URL>
```

2. On the Respository Github page, select your Issue in the "Issues"-Tab or create a new one in case it doesn't yet exist.
3. Open the issue.
4. On the right side, scroll down until you see the "Development" Section.
5. Click on the "Create a branch" link.
6. Back in your terminal, run:

```sh
git checkout <branch_name>
```

**Congratulations! You can now start coding**

## Keeping up-to-date {#up-to-date}

* Commit your changes regularily. You do this with:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m <Message>
```

(\<Message\> is a very short description of what you did **since you last committed**)

* Also regularily, remember to run `git fetch` and `git pull` to keep your local repository up-to-date with the upstream repository (the one on github)

* Push your changes on a frequent basis (`git push`). **Do not only push when you are done**. This will help everyone keep an eye on what you are doing and can intervene early if your work goes in the wrong direction. That way, you don't spend valuable time on things that are not needed.

If you encounter **any** issues, ask someone for help

## Your duties

* If you are requested to review a Pull Request, review that pull request. If you have any questions, aks! If you do not ask, no one will know you need help, and you will start feeling overwhelmed because you do not understand what is happening.
* If you are not the author of a pull request, do not merge pull requests as soon as you are able to. The pull requests owner should be the one to merge it once it has been reviewed by 2+ people.

## Starting a task

If your task is not yet represented by an issue, talk to your team to discuss opening your issue. If the team is not reachable for whatever reason, create the issue yourself.

1. Go to your issue's page. Carefully read the issue to gather what you should do.
2. Make sure, that **the issue is actually assigned to you**, if that is not the case, ask in the team if there was a misassignment.
3. On the issues website, scroll down until you see the "development" section on the right sidebar.
4. Click the blue "Create a branch" link. If that does not exist, you should see instead a button that leads to a branch.
5. Checkout that branch to your local development environment.
6. You can now start developing and working on your task. Remeber to follow the steps in the keeping-up-to-date section.
7. Once you are done with your task, go ahead and open a pull request for your branch.
